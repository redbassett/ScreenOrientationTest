This is a test app to demonstrate issues with programatically setting screen orientation in Android activities.

### Steps to reproduce:
1. Build and run app
2. Rotate device to landscape orientation
3. Tap the "Go to Second Activity" button

The second activity will render in landscape, then animate to portrait.
